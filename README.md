AMONGSUS i made a discord bot and i hate it.

has three main functions (only one that works tho):
1) if it detects "among us" in any message, it will tell you to shut up (only one that works)
2) can trigger a mode where it spams among us every 1.5 seconds (havent tested yet, too lazy)
3) among us "rpg" discord game - 
    complete tasks to win, random possibilities of events like encounters (ex. imposter kill) (unfinished, messed up the code gg)
